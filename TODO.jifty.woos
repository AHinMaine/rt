RUZ:

don't get why null_reference is record method instead of column property,
naming is not obvious, as well.

check_create_rights and refernces don't play well together as you have to
write a lot of code of additional checks.

As well, you can not return another error code - validation is not applied at
this moment, so some arguments may be invalid. May be we need some validation
and canonicalization stack in create, so you can safely call either of them
from each other.
