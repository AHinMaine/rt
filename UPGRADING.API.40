* all the method names must use foo_bar, so do keys of method arguments
* config vars can be both FooBar or foo_bar, we should support both, i.e. when
calling ->get or ->set, we can use both conventions. convention saved in file is
FooBar. 
* txn->type should be foo_bar
* values of callback_name should stay camel case, since they are also the file  names
