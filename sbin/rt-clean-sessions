=head1 name

rt-clean-sessions - clean old and duplicate RT sessions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    rt-clean-sessions [--debug] [--older <NUM>[H|D|M|Y]]

    rt-clean sessions
    rt-clean sessions --debug
    rt-clean sessions --older 10D
    rt-clean sessions --debug --older 1M

=head1 description

Script cleans RT sessions from DB or dir with sessions data.
Leaves in DB only one session per RT user and sessions that aren't older
than specified(see options).

Script is safe because data in the sessions is temporary and can be deleted.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 older

Date interval in the C<< <NUM>[<unit>] >> format. Default unit is D(ays),
H(our), M(onth) and Y(ear) are also supported.

For exmaple: C<rt-clean sessions --older 1M> would delete all sessions that are
older than 1 month.

=head2 debug

Turn on debug output.

=head1 NOTES

Functionality similar to this is implemented in
html/Elements/SetupSessionCookie ; however, that does not guarantee
that a session will be removed from disk and database soon after the
timeout expires.  This script, if run from a cron job, will ensure
that the timed out sessions are actually removed from disk; the Mason
component just ensures that the old sessions are not reusable before
the cron job gets to them.
