=head2 callback

Method replaces deprecated component C<Element/Callback>.

Takes hash with optional C<CallbackPage>, C<Callbackname>
and C<CallabckOnce> arguments, other arguments are passed
throught to callback components.

=over4

=item CallbackPage

Page path relative to the root, leading slash is mandatory.
By default is equal to path of the caller component.

=item Callbackname

name of the callback. C<Default> is used unless specified.

=item CallbackOnce

By default is false, otherwise runs callbacks only once per
process of the server. Such callbacks can be used to fill
structures.

=back

Searches for callback components in
F<< /Callbacks/<any dir>/CallbackPage/Callbackname >>, for
example F</Callbacks/MyExtension/autohandler/Default> would
be called as default callback for F</autohandler>.
