  RT::Model::ScripCollection - a collection of RT Scrip objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use RT::Model::ScripCollection;

=head1 description


=head1 METHODS



=cut

use warnings;
use strict;

package RT::Model::ScripCollection;
use base qw/RT::SearchBuilder/;

=head2 limit_to_queue

Takes a queue id (numerical) as its only argument. Makes sure that 
Scopes it pulls out apply to this queue (or another that you've selected with
another call to this method

=cut

sub limit_to_queue {
    my $self  = shift;

    $self->limit(
        entry_aggregator => 'OR',
        column           => 'queue',
        value            => "$queue"
    ) if defined $queue;

}

=head2 limit_to_global

Makes sure that 
Scopes it pulls out apply to all queues (or another that you've selected with
another call to this method or limit_ToQueue

=cut

sub limit_to_global {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->limit(
        entry_aggregator => 'OR',
        column           => 'queue',
        value            => 0
    );

}

=head2 next

Returns the next scrip that this user can see.

=cut

    }

    #if there never was any scrip
    else {
        return (undef);
    }

}

=head2 apply

Run through the relevant scrips.  Scrips will run in order based on 
description.  (Most common use case is to prepend a number to the description,
forcing the scrips to run in ascending alphanumerical order.)
