  RT::Model::GroupMember - a member of an RT Group

=head1 SYNOPSIS

RT::Model::GroupMember should never be called directly. It should ONLY
only be accessed through the helper functions in RT::Model::Group;

If you're operating on an RT::Model::GroupMember object yourself, you B<ARE>
doing something wrong.

=head1 description




=head1 METHODS




=cut

package RT::Model::GroupMember;

use strict;

use Jifty::DBI::Record schema {

    column member_id => references RT::Model::Principal;

};


=head2 create { Group => undef, Member => undef }

Add a Principal to the group Group.
if the Principal is a group, automatically inserts all
members of the principal into the cached members table recursively down.

Both Group and Member are expected to be RT::Model::Principal objects

=head2 _stash_user PRINCIPAL

Create { Group => undef, Member => undef }

Creates an entry in the groupmembers table, which lists a user
as a member of himself. This makes ACL checks a whole bunch easier.
This happens once on user create and never ever gets yanked out.

PRINCIPAL is expected to be an RT::Model::Principal object for a user

This routine expects to be called inside a transaction by RT::Model::User->create
