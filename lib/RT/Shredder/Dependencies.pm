=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates new empty collection of dependecies.

    my $proto = shift;

=head2 _push_dependencies

Put in objects into collection.
Takes
base_object - any supported object of RT::Record subclass;
Flags - flags that describe relationship between target and base objects;
target_objects - any of RT::Collection or RT::Record subclassed objects
or array ref on list of this objects;
Shredder - RT::Shredder object.
