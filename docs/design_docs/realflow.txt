- I have a MonitoredQueue that sets tickets to "Monitored"
  if its subject matches /monitored/.
  
- I want to have a kind of Ticket that are 'Monitored'.
- I want all monitored tickets, when they are overdue for
  14 days, to:
    - send notification to manager
    - mark as stalled
- I want all monitored tickets, when they are overdue for
  28 days, to:
    - mark as rejected
- I want to query all tickets that are monitored as such
- I want to modify 14 => 15 and have it affect all existing
  tickets that are monitored

{
- I want to add a new "overdue for 27 days, add a 'ultimatum'
  correspondence to it" rule for all monitored tickets.
- I want to add a new "overdue for 27 days, add a 'ultimatum'
  correspondence to it" rule for all _new_ monitored tickets
  without affecting existing ones.
}

- The user of orderRequest queue needs to fill a numeric "CF",
  called "Price".
- On creation, it needs to create following approvals:
    - "Manager" approval if CF.Price is > 1000
    - "President" approval if CF.Price is > 2000
- When all of "M", "P" are resolved (if any, or if there were none
  to begin with), Create a new approval, "Finance".
- If any approvals above is rejected, reject the original ticket.
- If "Finance" is resolved, resolve original ticket.
- If "Finance" is rejected, create an approval for "CEO".
- If "CEO" is resolved, resolve the original ticket.
- If "CEO" is rejected, reject the original ticket.
