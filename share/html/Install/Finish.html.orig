<div class="intro">
<p>
Congratulations! You've completed the initial configuration of RT.
</p>

<p>
But if not, just click "Finish Installation" below. You should be taken directly
to a login page. You'll be able to log in with username of <tt>root</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
If you've changed web port, you have to restart the server.
</p>

<p>
The settings you've chosen are stored in <% RT::Installer->configFile %>,
should you need to refine your configuration further. Using
`<tt>chmod -w '<% RT::Installer->configFile %>'</tt>` will prevent this
installation from being run again.
</p>
