<h1>You're almost there!</h1>
You haven't yet configured your webserver to run RT.

You appear to have installed RT's web interface correctly, but haven't yet configured your web
server to "run" the RT server which powers the web interface.

The next step is to edit your webserver's configuration file to instruct it to use
RT's <strong>mod_perl</strong>, <strong>FastCGI</strong> or <strong>SpeedyCGI</strong> handler.

If you need commercial support, please contact us at sales@bestpractical.com.
