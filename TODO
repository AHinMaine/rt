API changes
    check that MIME tools have camel case args

things we ripped out that need to be added back

    external auth
    autocreate of users

RT has some inconsistency in recording of Status changes,
some time it could be (Type = Status, Field = Status) or
(Type = Set, Field = Status). I think it should be fixed
to the latter.

RT::load_config and other in RT package should be replaced with RT->load_config
