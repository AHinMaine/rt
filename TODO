API changes
    check that MIME tools have camel case args

things we ripped out that need to be added back

    external auth
    autocreate of users

RT has some inconsistency in recording of Status changes,
some time it could be (Type = Status, Field = Status) or
(Type = Set, Field = Status). I think it should be fixed
to the latter.


things need to do or fix before releasing alpha.

with current Jifty version, I got a very weird problem, in the top actions,
current output is( I removed unrelative output ):

<label accesskey="9">
  <select name="queue" onchange="document.CreateTicketInQueue.submit()"
class="select-queue">
  <option value="1" > General </option>
</select>
<form action="/Ticket/Create.html" name="create_ticket_in_queue"
id="CreateTicketInQueue">
<input type="submit" class="button" value="New ticket in" />&nbsp;
</label>

<div id="topactions">
<span class="topaction" id="topaction-a">
</form>
</span>
</div>

it seems the call $m->scomp('/Elements/CreateTicket') in Elements/Tabs makes
some output instead of returning it, all the part above <div> should go into
the "topaction-a" span element, and so on.
I bet it's Jifty's problem but not 100% sure, Jifty gurus, SOS!

3.8.2 starts to use Test::Warn to test the warning output, but since we use
Log::Log4perl in Jifty, seems Test::Warn can't capture the warning any more.
( I dig a bit, they all play with $SIG{__WARN__}, which I think they collapse )

suggestion please
